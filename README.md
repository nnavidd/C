The "libft" project at 42 is a foundational project that we are often required to complete as part of the curriculum at 42 coding schools. 

The libft project at 42 aims to encourage us to develop a strong understanding of programming fundamentals in the C language. Instead of relying on built-in functions from standard libraries, we are challenged to implement our library of functions, referred to as "libft." This library becomes a crucial resource for us throughout our time at 42, serving as a foundation for future projects.

**Key Components:**
1. **Libc Functions:**
   We are required to implement a set of standard C library functions, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, and more. The goal is to create functions that replicate the behavior of these standard functions.

2. **Additional Functions:**
   In addition to libc functions, we are often tasked with creating supplementary functions that showcase our problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms. These functions can range from string manipulations to memory management like `split` and so on.

3. **Bonus Section:**
   The project often includes a "bonus" section where we have the opportunity to implement additional functions that go beyond the basic requirements. This allows us to showcase creativity and an in-depth understanding of programming concepts.

**Requirements:**
1. **Norm Compliance:**
   Code written for all projects must adhere to the 42 coding norm. This norm includes specific coding style guidelines that we are expected to follow, promoting readability and consistency in the codebase.

2. **Individual Effort:**
   The libft project is usually designed to be completed individually. It serves as an opportunity for us to showcase their individual coding and problem-solving abilities.

**Significance:**
Completing the libft project is a significant milestone for us at 42. It not only reinforces fundamental programming concepts but also serves as a reference library for subsequent forwarding projects. The experience gained from implementing these foundational functions contributes to the development of strong coding skills and a deeper understanding of how various programming constructs work at a low level.
